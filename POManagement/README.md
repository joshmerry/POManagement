# PO Management System

## Overview
The PO Management System is a web application designed to manage purchase orders efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing, creating, and managing purchase orders.

## Files in the Project

### `POList.html`
This file contains the layout for the Purchase Orders List page. It includes a navigation bar on the left with links to various sections such as Home, Cost Management, Invoices, and Purchase Orders. The main content area displays a table of purchase orders with columns for PO Number, Order Date, Buyer, Supplier, Total Amount, and Status.

### `POProductMapping.html`
This file mirrors the layout and contents of `POList.html`, including the same left navigation bar and structure. It is intended to manage the mapping of products to purchase orders.

## Usage
To use the application, open `POList.html` or `POProductMapping.html` in a web browser. The navigation bar allows you to navigate between different sections of the application.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement dynamic content loading for purchase orders.
- Add functionality for editing and deleting purchase orders.
- Integrate with a backend service for data persistence.
